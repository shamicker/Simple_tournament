# Simple_tournament
Udacity IPND/Fullstack Tournament Project

This is my basic version of the Project. It was created so I could figure out what I was doing, and then to build on that for the more complicated, multi-tournament one.

- I can't figure out how to merge all the tournament projects (the original fork, the simple version, and the multi-tournament version) into one. If and when I figure it out, I'll merge them together!
